## Milestone 4 Progress

Stefan Brand: I worked in the software engineer role and helped refactor all of our previous test code to use mocks and stubs when needed.  I did not add any new tests during this milestone because we did not add anymore game logic.

Vibha Alangar: I worked in the software engineer in test role this week. I spend most of my time adding test code to make sure that we checked all boundaries. A lot of the tests I added automatically passed because Michael had taken care of error checking in the last milestone, but now we can be certain that the correct error-checks are in place, which will also be helpful when we do regression testing. Also, I added a few excpetions, specific to different cases. 

Michael Trittin: I worked as the software engineer in test for this milestone. I spent the majority of my time refactoring our code in order to meet the metrics requirements, and to introduce quality into our project. You can find our current metrics settings in the 'METRICS.md' file in this same directory. Additionally, I added some tests and exception handling to our Game class using TDD.
