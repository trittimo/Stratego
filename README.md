## Milestone 4 Progress

Stefan Brand: I worked in the software engineer role and helped refactor all of our previous test code to use mocks and stubs when needed.  I did not add any new tests during this milestone because we did not add anymore game logic.

Vibha Alangar: I worked as the test engineer for this milestone. I spent most of my time working to fix a bug discovered in the last milestone. Now the pieces can be moved from the PieceSelector panel onto the actual map, and they can be moved from one space in the map to another space. I also spent some time adding small things like a Jpanel on the message display section to display whose turn it is, so we can use them to help us debug later. 


Michael Trittin: I worked as the test engineer for this milestone. I spent a lot of time writing GUI code and beginning the process of hooking it up to the game logic. Much of the GUI code was shifted around and modified to better suit our expanding needs in the project. It is still in its early stages, but I did make quite a bit of progress from the previous milestone. I also started the process of writing systems tests, although I did not spend much time doing so.

Yujia Wu: So, working with Stefan as software engineer, and I also helped refactor the tests for Board using mocks and stubs. And we did not implement any new features.
