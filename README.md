## Milestone 2 Progress

Stefan Brand: I worked in the software engineer role and helped implement the Board and Piece classes.  I used TTD while developing these classes and the control logic of the application.
I spent the majority of the time on this milestone pair programming with Vibha but also spent time finishing up the Board class on my own.
I added some more detail to some of the Javadocs in the Board class.

Vibha Alangar: I worked in the software engineer role and Stefan and I implement both the Board and Piece class, as well as wrote unit tests for them. We pair programmed, using TDD to develope the basic logic of these classes. Stefan and I worked together and checked each others work. 

Michael Trittin: I worked as the software engineer in test for this milestone. I used TDD in order to add error handling and to improve the infrastructure of our project. I spent the majority of my time during this milestone trying to plan for our future needs and programming them into the Board/Piece classes. This included adding new exceptions/exception handlers which I thought would be helpful when we integrate the logic into the GUI. I also setup my Eclipse workspace to format our source code so that when we commit, all files will be standardized (i.e. indentation, bracket choice, etc. will be the same). Lastly, I began work on applying dependency injection to our GUI classes in the development-trittimo branch; however, since it does not yet compile, I have not committed these changes.

Yujia Wu: Worked as TestEngineer in Milestone 2. I created several new graphics classes and put them all together in Main, which game would take place in. And I tend to set up the board so it initializes with pieces in the right location on it. For every piece, I had pictures download from the Internet for later use. Successfully got pieces to be able to move. For milestone 3, I started the game with pieces displaying on side of the screen so the user can click the piece and move it to wherever they want it to be on the game board. Fixed the pieces, so they look nicer.
