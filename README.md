## Milestone 4 Progress

Stefan Brand: I worked in the software engineer in test role. I added some error handling and input checks to getWinner().  I also wrote a decision table for all the cases of pieces attacking each other and the outcomes.  I wrote parameterized integration tests that are ready to be tested when the code is updated to use getWinner in the game class.

Vibha Alangar: I worked as a software engineer with Michael this week. We implemented code coverage, and got branch coverage up to 100%. In doing so, we found and fixed some bugs in our code, as well as made some of our code much more efficient. 


Michael Trittin: I worked as the test engineer for this milestone. I spent a lot of time writing GUI code and beginning the process of hooking it up to the game logic. Much of the GUI code was shifted around and modified to better suit our expanding needs in the project. It is still in its early stages, but I did make quite a bit of progress from the previous milestone. I also started the process of writing systems tests, although I did not spend much time doing so.

Yujia Wu: So, working with Stefan as software engineer, and I also helped refactor the tests for Board using mocks and stubs. And we did not implement any new features.
