# Rose Build Library 

At present the project is seeded with sample code, test cases for the sample code, gradle build file, gitlab-ci config file, and JaCoco coverage tool setup. The build process also retrieves the code coverage metrics and shows it in the build window of GitLab.

The following resources were used to setup the project:
* [Gradle JaCoco Plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/jacoco_plugin.html)
* [Gradle User Guide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html), especially the following chapters:
	* [Chapter 7 - Java Quick Start](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/tutorial_java_projects.html)
	* [Chapter 8 - Dependency Management](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/artifact_dependencies_tutorial.html)
	* [Chapter 14 - More about Tasks](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/more_about_tasks.html)

Please see the **build.gradle** and **.gitlab-ci.yml** for more detials.

## Eclipse Setup Instruction

The project was setup using Eclipse (Mars 1 - Java Developer). It can be downloaded from the [On-Campus AFS Server](http://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/csse/binaries/Eclipse/mars/). You will also need to install Gradle plugin from [Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/gradle-integration-eclipse-0). After that, the project can be built within Eclipse IDE.

To build the project in Eclipse, right-click on the project -> Run As -> Gradle Build ... -> Under Gradle task box, enter **build** -> Apply -> Run. Your build should start. Note that you must **install JDK 8 (not JRE)** for all of these to work. 


Milestone 2 Progress

Stefan Brand: I worked in the software engineer role and helped implement the Board and Piece classes.  I used TTD while developing these classes and the control logic of the application.
I spent the majority of the time on this milestone pair programming with Vibha but also spent time finishing up the Board class on my own.
I added some more detail to some of the Javadocs in the Board class.
