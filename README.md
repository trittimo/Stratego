## Milestone 4 Progress

Stefan Brand: I worked in the software engineer role and helped refactor all of our previous test code to use mocks and stubs when needed.  I did not add any new tests during this milestone because we did not add anymore game logic.

Vibha Alangar: I worked in the software engineer in test role this week. I spend most of my time adding test code to make sure that we checked all boundaries. A lot of the tests I added automatically passed because Michael had taken care of error checking in the last milestone, but now we can be certain that the correct error-checks are in place, which will also be helpful when we do regression testing. Also, I added a few excpetions, specific to different cases. 

Michael Trittin: I worked as the test engineer for this milestone. I spent a lot of time writing GUI code and beginning the process of hooking it up to the game logic. Much of the GUI code was shifted around and modified to better suit our expanding needs in the project. It is still in its early stages, but I did make quite a bit of progress from the previous milestone. I also started the process of writing systems tests, although I did not spend much time doing so.

Yujia Wu: So, working with Stefan as software engineer, and I also helped refactor the tests for Board using mocks and stubs. And we did not implement any new features.
