## Milestone 4 Progress

Stefan Brand: I worked as the test engineer. I first spent time adding comments to the GUI code to make it more understandable.  I also rearranged some things with the mouse handler and the GUI classes to reduce coupling.  I added functionality for the start of the game where each player puts down the starting pieces.  I updated the board background and tried experimenting with different piece colors and labels.  I discovered some bugs that we can fix in the next cycle.

Vibha Alangar: I worked as a software engineer with Michael this week. We implemented code coverage, and got branch coverage up to 100%. In doing so, we found and fixed some bugs in our code, as well as made some of our code much more efficient. 


Michael Trittin: I worked as the test engineer for this milestone. I spent a lot of time writing GUI code and beginning the process of hooking it up to the game logic. Much of the GUI code was shifted around and modified to better suit our expanding needs in the project. It is still in its early stages, but I did make quite a bit of progress from the previous milestone. I also started the process of writing systems tests, although I did not spend much time doing so.

Yujia Wu: So, working with Stefan as software engineer, and I also helped refactor the tests for Board using mocks and stubs. And we did not implement any new features.
